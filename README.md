# Machine Learning for Flappy Bird using Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm

Here is the source code for a HTML5 project that implements a machine learning algorithm in the Flappy Bird video game using neural networks and a genetic algorithm. The program teaches a little bird how to flap optimally in order to fly safely through barriers as long as possible.

Here you can also watch a short video with a simple presentation of the algorithm:

All code is written in HTML5 using [Phaser framework](http://phaser.io/) and [Synaptic Neural Network library](https://synaptic.juancazala.com) for neural network implementation.

## Neural Network Architecture

To play the game, each unit (bird) has its own neural network consisted of the next 3 layers:
1. an input layer with 2 neurons presenting what a bird sees:
     
     ```
     1) horizontal distance between the bird and the closest gap
     2) height difference between the bird and the closest gap
     ```
     
2. a hidden layer with 6 neurons
3. an output layer with 1 neuron used to provide an action as follows:
     
     ```
    if output > 0.5 then flap else do nothing
     ```

There is used [Synaptic Neural Network library](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) to implement entire artificial neural network instead of making a new one from the scratch.

## The Main Concept of Machine Learning

The main concept of machine learning implemented in this program is based on the neuro-evolution form. It uses evolutionary algorithms such as a genetic algorithm to train artificial neural networks. Here are the main steps:

1. create a new population of 10 units (birds) with a **random neural network** 
2. let all units play the game simultaneously by using their own neural networks
3. for each unit calculate its **fitness** function to measure its quality as:

    ```
    fitness = total travelled distance - distance to the closest gap
    ```

4. when all units are killed, evaluate the current population to the next one using **genetic algorithm operators** (selection, crossover and mutation) as follows:

    ```
    1. sort the units of the current population in decreasing order by their fitness ranking
    2. select the top 4 units and mark them as the winners of the current population
    3. the 4 winners are directly passed on to the next population
    4. to fill the rest of the next population, create 6 offsprings as follows:
        - 1 offspring is made by a crossover of two best winners
        - 3 offsprings are made by a crossover of two random winners
        - 2 offsprings are direct copy of two random winners
    5. to add some variations, apply random mutations on each offspring.
    ```
    
5. go back to the step 2

## Implementation

### Requirements

Since the program is written in HTML5 using [Phaser framework](http://phaser.io/) and [Synaptic Neural Network library](http://caza.la/synaptic/#/) you need these files:

- **phaser.min.js**
- **synaptic.min.js**

### gameplay.js 
The entire game logic is implemented in **gameplay.js** file. It consists of the following classes:

- `App.Main`, the main routine with the following essential functions:
	- _preload()_ to preload all assets
	- _create()_ to create all objects and initialize a new genetic algorithm object
	- _update()_ to run the main loop in which the Flappy Bird game is played by using AI neural networks and the population is evolved by using genetic algorithm
	- _drawStatus()_ to display information of all units
	
- `TreeGroup Class`, extended Phaser Group class to represent a moving barrier. This group contains a top and a bottom Tree sprite.

- `Tree Class`, extended Phaser Sprite class to represent a Tree sprite.

- `Bird Class`, extended Phaser Sprite class to represent a Bird sprite.

- `Text Class`, extended Phaser BitmapText class used for drawing text.

### genetic.js 

The genetic algorithm is implemented in **genetic.js** file which consists of the following class:

- `GeneticAlgorithm Class`, the main class to handle all genetic algorithm operations. It needs two parameters: **_max_units_** to set a total number of units in population and **_top_units_** to set a number of top units (winners) used for evolving population. Here are its essential functions:

   - _reset()_ to reset genetic algorithm parameters
   - _createPopulation()_ to create a new population
   - _activateBrain()_ to activate the AI neural network of an unit and get its output action according to the inputs
   - _evolvePopulation()_ to evolve the population by using genetic operators (selection, crossover and mutations)
   - _selection()_ to select the best units from the current population
   - _crossOver()_ to perform a single point crossover between two parents
   - _mutation()_ to perform random mutations on an offspring
